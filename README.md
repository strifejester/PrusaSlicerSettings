# Prusa Slicer Settings
I created this as a place for people to share and download Prusa Slicer settings for various printers. If you would like to export your settings and have them imported please create a pull request and lets get this repo growing.

If you have a file for your printer please feel free to create a request. I am hoping to grow this beyond just my printers. Also please if you create a request let me know if the printer is mostly stock or not as I am hoping this will make a good starting point for people who get a new printer. If you have heavily modified the printer there is a good chance your settings will not work on a stock unit.
